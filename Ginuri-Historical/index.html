            Sigiriya is an rock fotress located in Northern Mathale District
            near the town of Dambulla in the Central province Srilanka. It is
            site of historical and archelogical significance that is dominated
            by massive column of granite rock approximately 180 m (590 ft) high.
            King Kashyapa built his palace on top of this rock and decorated its
            sides with colourful frescoes.On a small plateau about halfway up
            the side of this rock he built a gateway in the form of an enormous
            lion. The name of this place is derived from this
            structure;Sīnhāgiri, the Lion Rock. Sigiriya today is a UNESCO
            listed World Heritage Site. Sigiriya paintings would have covered
            most of the western face of the rock, an area 140 m (460 ft) long
            and 40 m (130 ft) high. There are references in the graffiti to 500
            ladies in these paintings. However, most have been lost forever.
            More frescoes, different from those on the rock face, can be seen
            elsewhere, for example on the ceiling of the location called the
            "Cobra Hood Cave" The gardens of Sigiriya are one of the most
            important aspects of the site, as they are among the oldest
            landscaped gardens in the world. The gardens are divided into three
            distinct but linked forms: water gardens, cave and boulder gardens,
            and terraced gardens. The water gardens can be seen in the central
            section of the western precinct. Three principal gardens are found
            here. The first garden consists of a plot surrounded by water. It is
            connected to the main precinct using four causeways, with gateways
            placed at the head of each causeway. This garden is built according
            to an ancient garden form known as char bagh, and is one of the
            oldest surviving models of this form. The boulder gardens consist of
            several large boulders linked by winding pathways. The gardens
            extend from the northern slopes to the southern slopes of the hills
            at the foot of Sigiris rock. Most of these boulders had a building
            or pavilion upon them; there are cuttings that were used as footings
            for brick walls and beams. They used to be pushed off from the top
            to attack enemies when they approached.

            Thivanka Pilimage had been built by King Parakramabahu (1153-1186)
            as part of the Jethavanarama Complex. Since the large image of
            Buddha has been curved in 3 places, this has been given the name
            “Thivanka” which literally means three curves. As most other
            structures of this era, this is too built with bricks including the
            statue. The Buddha statue at the Thivanka Pilimage is about 8 meters
            in height but today the part of the statue above the head has been
            destroyed. The statue as at today is 6.6 metres tall. The building
            is 133 feet long and 67.6” feet wide. The walls are 7-12 feet thick
            making the internal size of the building much smaller. Interestingly
            the walls and the roof of this image house was built entirely out of
            brick and is known as the Gedige type of image houses similar to the
            previously visited image houses of Thuparama and Lankatilaka image
            houses in Polonnaruwa. However, similar to the Lankatilaka the
            original roof brick vaulted roof has defragmented and only a small
            section of the roof remains on the southern side of the structure.
            The inside walls of the buildings has been decorated with frescoes
            showing the Jataka Stories (prior births of Buddha before
            enlightenment) although most of the masonry has been destroyed, the
            colorful drawings can be still seen on the areas where masonry is
            intact. The entrance to the building consists of two guard stones
            and two “Korawak Gala” The outer restoration of the this image house
            has been carried out at a snail pace for the last 15 years and has
            been covered with shuttering though out the this period.

            Medirigiriya Watadageya in Sri Lanka is a monastery located in the
            kingdom of Polonaruwa, dating back to over two millennium. The
            centerpiece or point of interest of the whole monastery is the
            Medirigiriya Vatadage. It was an architectural masterpiece of those
            early eras which housed the Stupa completely within it. Only 7 such
            stupa houses remain today in Sri Lanka. Records during the time of
            King Kanitta Tissa (AD 192 – 194) of Anuradhapura show that this
            Vatadage was much worshipped and respected at that time. However the
            ancient brahmi characters engraved in the bricks and the stone
            carvings, which pre date carvings found in the other Vatadages,
            point towards a long history dating from the pre-Christian Era. The
            monastery was supported by, and was donated to by many kings
            throughout Sri Lanka’s history. In particular, the stupa which forms
            the centerpiece of the Vatadage appears to have been built in the
            time of Aggabodhi I (564 – 598 AD). The Medirigiriya Watadageya in
            Sri Lanka was a building supported by three concentric rings of
            pillars, and housed the stupa completely. The pillars and ruins
            still stand today. The Medirigiriya Watadageya in Sri Lanka was
            built on a rocky outcrop. It had a single entrance facing north. The
            doorway was a huge carved stone frame built at the bottom of a
            staircase. The frame measured 9.75 feet in height and 4.75 feet in
            breadth. The doorway was followed by a climb of 27 stone steps to a
            large resting area. Four steps lead from the resting area to the
            actual Stupa house. The Stupa House had a low stone wall, about a
            meter tall, which ran around it. Seated against the wall facing the
            four cardinal directions were four exquisite stone Buddha statues.
            There was a huge 33 feet-long sleeping Buddha in the Stupa House.
            The Stupa reigned in the center. The stupa was surrounded by stone
            pillars in three concentric rings. The outer ring had 32 pillars
            standing at nine feet, the middle ring 20 pillars standing at 16
            feet, and finally, the inner ring had 16 pillars standing at 17
            feet. Some archaeologists argue that there never was a roof, while
            other’s say that the remaining pillars in the ruins still standing
            prove that they supported a roof. The heights of the rings of
            pillars point toward a roof that would have been very tall in the
            center to accommodate the spire of the Stupa, while sloping downward
            in a dome-like fashion to a comparatively lower point at the outer
            edges.

            Polonnaruwa is a city that holds great significance to Sri Lanka’s
            historical image and is home for many historically beautiful places
            that have been built in the eras of Kings when they rules, then
            Ceylon. The uniqueness of this beautiful past of then Ceylon, is
            seen in the fact that the Kings of that time took great pains in
            construction processes, as even today these relics and ruins still
            stand tall and strong. One such historical site in the Nelum Pokuna
            of Polonnaruwa. “Pokuna” or baths that are found in Polonnaruwa are
            said to be of reasonable dimensions. Some examples are the
            architecturally impeccable Kumara pokuna that is found close to the
            Palace of King Parakramabahu, the pokuna that lies close to the rest
            house is said to that of King Nissankamalla and the austere baths of
            the Alahana Pirivena. Yet a jewel of pokuna architecture lies
            concealed along the lonely highway to the southern town, far from
            the bus loads of pilgrims and visitors crowding the more renowned
            quadrangle of Polonnaruwa packed with ruins from distinct
            architecture and style dynasties. The Nelum pokuna or the Lotus bath
            is a small stone bath with a distinctive layout, constructed in the
            descending shape of eight petalled lotuses. The fine cut granite is
            an absolute pleasure for the contemporary day tourist. With its
            ancient flowering trees, the atmosphere of garden-like environments
            enhances its magnificence. The chronicle talks of a lotus bath built
            by Parakramabahu the Great among many lakes. It is thought to be the
            King’s bath for the monks of the Jetavana Vihara.

            Yapahuwa was one of the ephemeral capitals of medieval Sri Lanka.
            The citadel of Yapahuwa lying midway between Kurunagala and
            Anuradhapura was built around a huge granite rock rising abruptly
            almost a hundred meters above the surrounding lowlands. Yapahuwa
            served as the capital of Sri Lanka in the latter part of the 13th
            century (1273–1284). Built on a huge, 90 meter high rock boulder in
            the style of the Sigiriya rock fortress, Yapahuwa was a palace and
            military stronghold against foreign invaders. The palace and
            fortress were built by King Buvanekabahu I (1272–1284) in the year
            1273. Many traces of ancient battle defences can still be seen,
            while an ornamental stairway, is its biggest showpiece. This
            staircase is a long one with around 100 steps. On top of the rock
            are the remains of a stupa, a Bodhi tree enclosure, and a rock
            shelter/cave used by Buddhist monks, indicating that earlier this
            site was used as a Buddhist monastery, like many boulders and hills
            in the area. There are several caves at the base of the rock. In one
            of them there is a shrine with Buddha images. One cave has a Brahmi
            script inscription. At the southern base of the rock there is a
            fortification with two moats and ramparts. In this enclosure there
            are the remains of a number of buildings including a Buddhist
            shrine. There is also a Buddhist temple called Yapahuwa Rajamaha
            Vihara built during the Kandyan period.
